## functionality forlder

Holds all the functionality of the application
Parsers, validators, custom hooks, etc.
The idea is to reuse any logic and leave the components clean, only with the rendering code

### Alternative structure

This can also be called 'logic' or 'state'?
This can be replaced by the reducers (if redux or like-redux is used)
